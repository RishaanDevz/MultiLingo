🌐 Bidirectional Translation System
Welcome to the Bidirectional Translation System! This funky project uses the awesome power of the M5 Atom Echo, OpenAI GPT-4, and OpenAI Whisper to deliver seamless bidirectional translation. Speak into the M5 Atom Echo, and watch (or rather, listen) as your words get transcribed, translated, and spoken back in another language. All with a simple push of a button! 🎉

Features
🎤 Speech Recognition: Leveraging OpenAI Whisper for top-notch transcription.
🌐 Translation: Utilizing OpenAI GPT-4 for accurate and context-aware translations.
🗣️ Text-to-Speech: Transforming translated text back to spoken words.
🔄 Bidirectional Communication: Supports smooth back-and-forth conversations between two languages.
Hardware Requirements
M5 Atom Echo: A compact and versatile microcontroller with a built-in microphone and speaker.
Software Requirements
Python: Our main programming language.
OpenAI GPT-4 API: For translation services.
OpenAI Whisper: For speech-to-text transcription.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) System: For converting text back to speech.
